Java Coding Competition 2:

For this coding competition, you will have ten more problems to solve in 30 minutes, and the first team to solve them all correctly will win.
You can have teams of up to four people, or work individually. Write one program called CodingCompetition with all the methods for the competition.Good luck!

Problem 1: Return a reversed int Array
Given an int Array arr, write a method int[] reverseArray(int[] arr) that returns an Array containing all of arr's elements in reverese order.

Problem 2: Find Anagram
Given two Strings, write a method boolean isAnagram(String str1, String str2) that returns true if they are anagrams for each other, and false if they are not.

Problem 3: String to String[]
Given a String str, write a method String[] toStringArray(String str) return a String Array that separates str each time there is whitespace or punctuation.

Problem 4: Swap numbers
Given two ints, write a method swap(int a, int b) to swap their values and print them WITHOUT using a temp variable.

Problem 5: Sum of Digits
Given an int, write a method int sumDigits(int n) that returns the number of digits in an integer.

Problem 6: Factorial
Given an int, write a method int factorial(int n) that returns the factorial of the number. (Hint: factorial is the product of a number and all the integers below it.
For example, factorial of 5 = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.)

Problem 7: Remove Duplicates
Given an Array of Strings, write a method String[] removeDuplicates(String[] arr) that returns arr with all duplicate elements removed

Problem 8: First n prime numbers
Given an int n, write a method int[] primes(n) that returns all prime numbers <= n.

Problem 9: Sort an Array of ints
Given an int[], write a method int[] sort(int[] arr) without using library methods that returns the elements of arr in order from lowest to highest.

Problem 10: Add two numbers without the + operator
Given two ints, write a method int add(int a, int b) that returns their sum WITHOUT using the + operator. (Hint: you need to use bitwise operators.)
