Coding Competition 1:

For this coding competition, you will have ten problems to solve in an hour, and the first team to solve them all correctly will win.
You can have teams of up to four people, or you can work individually. Write one program called CodingCompetition1 with all the methods for the competition.
Good luck!

Problem 1: Checking Uppercase
Given a String, write a method checkLowerCase(String s) that returns true if the String is in all lowercase and false otherwise.

Problem 2: Find Triangle Area
Given the three side lengths of a triangle, write a method getArea(int s1, int s2, int s3) That returns the area of a triangle with those three side lengths.
(Hint: Use Heron's Formula).

Problem 3: Check Perfect Squares
Given an int, write a method checkPerfectSquare(int n) that checks wether n is a perfect square and returns true if it is, and false if it isn't.

Problem 4: Find all Possible Combinations
Given the length of a String that only contains numbers and letters, write a method getAllCombinations(int length) that returns the number of possible 
combinations of letters and numbers in a String of that length. (Hint: Java is case-sensitive, so make sure to include both lowercase and uppercase letters).

Problem 5: Fibonacci Numbers
Write a method fibonacci(int n) that returns an array of the first n fibonacci numbers. (Hint: In the Fibonacci sequence, the next number is found 
by adding up the two numbers before it).

Problem 6: Compare Binary Strings
Given a two Strings representing binary numbers, write a method binaryCompareTo(String s1, String s2) that outputs -1 when the first number is larger, 1 
when the first number is smaller, and zero when they are the same.

Problem 7: Interest rate
Given one double and one int, write a method getInterest(int startingAmount, int y) That returns the value of startingAmount after y
years with an assumed 5% interest each year.

Problem 8: String to Array
Given a String with multiple words separated by spaces, write a method toArray(String s) that returns a String[] that contains all the words in the String
with any spaces or puncuation removed.

Problems 9-10: Mean and Mode
Given an array of ints, write two methods: getMean(int[] array), and getMode(int[] array) that return the average and the most frequently occurring number
in the array respectively. (Hint: If the array has no mode, return 0 for getMode).
